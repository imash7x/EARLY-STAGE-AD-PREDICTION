# EARLY-STAGE-AD-PREDICTION

The application of machine learning techniques to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) using MRI data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) marks a notable advancement in neurology and healthcare. The innovative approach, which combines deep learning models with a hybrid methodology integrating classical machine learning and domain-specific knowledge, has demonstrated significant success in achieving superior diagnostic accuracy for early-stage AD prediction. This success holds both conceptual and practical significance, as evidenced by the promising results obtained from the application of these models to the OASIS-1 and OASIS-2 datasets. These findings offer tangible proof of the models' effectiveness and practical utility in AD diagnosis, equipping clinicians with reliable tools for early detection and intervention.

Specifically, the hybrid stacked voting classifier model trained on the OASIS-1 dataset exhibited commendable performance, achieving an accuracy of approximately 79.83%. This accuracy signifies a notable ability to accurately classify instances from the test dataset. Additionally, with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics hovering around the 80% mark, the model demonstrates a well-balanced performance, effectively mitigating both false positives and false negatives. The detailed breakdown provided by the confusion matrix further reinforces the model's capability to accurately classify instances across different classes, an essential aspect of AD diagnosis.

Similarly, when applied to the OASIS-2 dataset, the hybrid stacked voting classifier model exhibited even more impressive results. With an accuracy of 97.22%, precision and recall scores nearing perfection, and an outstanding F1-score of 96.97%, the model demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the AUC score of 97.06% indicates excellent discriminative ability, further validating the model's efficacy in distinguishing between positive and negative instances.

This level of efficacy, coupled with the non-invasive nature and cost-effectiveness of MRI-based diagnosis, positions these hybrid models as invaluable tools in the early detection and management of AD. By leveraging deep learning techniques and integrating domain-specific knowledge, these models offer clinicians reliable and actionable insights into patients' cognitive health, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment strategies.

In summary, the hybrid stacked voting classifier models represent a significant advancement in AD diagnosis, offering both conceptual innovation and tangible results. Their efficacy in accurately predicting AD from MRI data underscores their potential to revolutionize neuroimaging analysis and improve patient outcomes in the battle against this debilitating disease.
